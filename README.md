<h2 id="supplies">2. The cardiovascular model</h2>
<h3 id="print-the-heart"> 2.1. Print the heart + case</h3>

The heart structure must have the following traits:
 - It should be flexible, so it can be compressed to simulate systole.
 - It should have two openings, which can make watertight connections with the tubing. Barbs were used for this. Our tubing was 1.25" in O.D.
 - Optionally, it may have a smaller opening to accomodate the endoscopic camera. This also must be watertight when the camera is inserted. 
 - It should have a volume that approximates the volume of the left ventricle at diastole (~100mL). The volume of a cone was used to roughly estimate this.

The flexible heart structure was modeled in Solidworks. The model is available for download [here](https://github.com/benholland1024/pulse-manager-tutorial/blob/main/heartStruct25mm.SLDPRT). The steps to create the model were:
 1. Sketch a cross section of half the heart structure wall (excluding the openings) with the desired volume.
 2. Use the "revolve boss/base" tool around the y axis.
 3. Create a new reference plane from the "Top" plane, near where the holes will be made.
 4. Create another reference plane rotated about 30deg, which will be the angle of the holes.
 5. Sketch the outer diameter of the holes, I used 37.55mm. Extrude boss/base that sketch so it sticks out about 20mm.
 6. Sketch the inner diamter of the holes, 32.25mm (.5mm bigger than 1.25"). Make an extruded cut to create the holes.
 7. Create a plane perpendicular to the one last created.
 8. Switch the view to "hidden lines visible" and sketch a cross section of one of the barbs, which should be 0.5mm by 4mm.
 9. Create a different sketch on the same plane, and draw a line through the center of the cylinder.
 10. Revolve the barb around the center line to create one barb.
 11. Use linear pattern to create 3 more barbs, evenly spaced.
 12. Repeat steps 4-11 to create a second hole (or use the "mirror pattern" tool).
